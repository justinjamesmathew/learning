i think i forgot the postgres database password. so thought of uninstalling and reinstalling postgres sql

steps i took to uninstall
1. go to /library/postgresSql
2. there is an uninstaller in the folder. run it.
3. run some commands like sudo rm /etc/postgres-reg.ini
4. tried to kill postgres related processes using this command "sudo lsof -i :5432" followed by kill. not successful.
5. to stop all postgres processes, this is the command that worked - brew services stop postgres

5. i was getting connection refused error on reinstalling.
6. during re-installation I was getting this error 
"Problem running post-install step. Installation may not complete correctly The database cluster initialisation failed."

7. this fixed all my problems ->



Uninstall PostgresSQL and then clean /Library/PostgreSQL/ Directory.
Open teminal and run :

sudo dscl . -create /Users/postgres UserShell /bin/sh

sudo dscl . -create /Users/postgres NFSHomeDirectory /Library/PostgreSQL

Install PostgresSQL
